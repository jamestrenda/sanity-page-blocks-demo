# Sanity Page Blocks Demo

This repository serves as a demo site for showcasing the Sanity Page Blocks plugin. It demonstrates how to configure and render page builder blocks using Sanity Studio and a front-end built with Next.js.

Quite a bit of the Next.js setup is based on the [Turbo Start](https://github.com/robotostudio/turbo-start-sanity) Sanity starter template, which provided a solid foundation for project structure and tooling decisions. Shout out to the team at [Roboto Studio](https://github.com/robotostudio) for that.
